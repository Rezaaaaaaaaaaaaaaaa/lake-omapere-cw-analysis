Subject: Lake Ōmāpere CW Analysis - Final Results

Hi Fleur and Annette,

I've completed the Lake Ōmāpere CW mitigation analysis. Here's a summary of the methodology and key results.

========================================
ANALYSIS SCOPE
========================================

50 Lake Ōmāpere catchment reaches
32 reaches with CW coverage (64%)
Baseline scenario: CLUESloads_baseline.csv (includes +0.66m lake rise)
Total baseline load: 2.30 t/y TP

========================================
METHODOLOGY
========================================

Step 1: P Fraction Splitting (ContaminantSplits.xlsx)
  - PartP (Particulate): 50%
  - DRP (Dissolved Reactive): 25%
  - DOP (Dissolved Organic): 25%

Step 2: Bank Erosion Allocation
  - 50% of each fraction → Bank Erosion (NOT mitigated)
  - 50% of each fraction → HYPE pathways (mitigated)

Step 3: HYPE Pathway Distribution (Hype.csv)
  - SR (Surface Runoff), TD (Tile Drainage), IF (Interflow)
  - SG (Shallow GW), DG (Deep GW), SD (Surface Drainage)
  - Each reach has unique % distribution

Step 4: Coverage Category Assignment
  - >4% coverage: ExtCode 1 (HIGH)
  - 2-4% coverage: ExtCode 2 (MEDIUM)
  - <2% coverage: ExtCode 3 (LOW)

Step 5: Apply LRFs (LRFs_years.xlsx Sheet 'CW')

  ExtCode 1 (HIGH >4%): PartP 100% removal, DRP/DOP 77% removal
  ExtCode 2 (MEDIUM 2-4%): PartP 100% removal, DRP/DOP 58% removal
  ExtCode 3 (LOW <2%): PartP 100% removal, DRP/DOP 52% removal

  Special cases:
  - Bank Erosion: NOT mitigated (100% remaining)
  - Deep GW dissolved P: NOT mitigated (bypasses CW)

Step 6: Clay Constraint (FSLData.csv)
  - If clay >50%: LRF = 0 (no CW effectiveness)

Step 7: Routing (Hydroedge2_5.csv, AttenCarry.csv)
  - Network routing with PstreamCarry attenuation factors
  - Mean PstreamCarry = 0.97 (minimal in-stream loss)
  - Routing amplification = 1.0

========================================
KEY RESULTS
========================================

OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS:
  Baseline TP:         2.30 t/y
  With CW:             1.54 t/y
  Total Reduction:     0.75 t/y (32.8%)

BY COVERAGE CATEGORY:
  High (>4%):    13 reaches, 39.4% avg reduction
  Medium (2-4%):  5 reaches, 36.8% avg reduction
  Low (<2%):     14 reaches, 36.1% avg reduction
  No CW:         18 reaches, 0% reduction

BASELINE COMPOSITION:
  Agricultural (TPAgGen): 1.83 t/y (79.5%)
  Sediment (soilP):       0.17 t/y (7.6%)
  Other (TPGen):          0.30 t/y (12.9%)

CW COVERAGE:
  Total area: 349.88 ha
  Mean: 7.0% of reach area
  Max: 68% (reach 1010359)

========================================

========================================
KEY FINDINGS
========================================

1. PartP (Particulate P) has 100% removal across all coverage levels - this drives overall effectiveness

2. Dissolved P (DRP/DOP) removal varies: 77% (high), 58% (medium), 52% (low)

3. Bank erosion (50% of load) limits maximum possible reduction to ~50%

4. Deep groundwater dissolved P bypasses CWs (not mitigated)

5. Higher CW coverage gives better reduction: 39.4% vs 36.1%

========================================
QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION
========================================

1. Bank erosion 50% - do you have Northland-specific data for refinement?

2. Deep GW bypass - does this align with Lake Ōmāpere hydrology?

3. Coverage thresholds (<2%, 2-4%, >4%) - appropriate for Type 1 GW and Type 2 SW CWs?

4. PstreamCarry factors - should these be adjusted for +0.66m lake scenario?

5. Next steps - presentation format? Sensitivity analysis? Additional scenarios?

========================================

All calculations verified and results consistent across output files.

Please let me know if you need clarification on any calculations or would like additional analysis.

Best regards,
Reza

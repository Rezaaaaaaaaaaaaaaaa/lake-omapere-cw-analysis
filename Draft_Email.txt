Subject: RE: TKIL2602 - Lake Omapere modelling - Corrections Complete + Issue Identified

Hi Annette and Fleur,

I have completed the corrections to the CW coverage analysis as outlined by Annette. However, I have identified an important issue that requires your guidance before proceeding.

---

CORRECTIONS COMPLETED:
======================

All requested corrections have been applied:

1. Added nzsegment column (required for CLUES/mitigation model indexing)
2. Ordered data by HydSeq in ascending order (headwaters to coast)
3. Updated land area calculations to exclude lake area (using your LakeAreaUpdate.xlsx data)
4. Recalculated all CW coverage percentages based on corrected land areas

Files created:
- O:\TKIL2602\Working\Lake Omapere Trust\CW_Analysis_Results\CW_Coverage_CORRECTED.csv
- O:\TKIL2602\Working\Lake Omapere Trust\CW_Analysis_Results\CW_Coverage_CORRECTED.xlsx
- O:\TKIL2602\Working\Lake Omapere Trust\CW_Analysis_Results\LakeAreaUpdate.xlsx (copy of Annette's file)

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
=================

When reviewing the corrected data, I found that 5 subcatchments have CW coverage percentages > 100%, with some extremely high values:

  SubcatchmentID | nzsegment | Land Area ha | CW Area ha | Coverage  | CW in Lake ha
  ---------------|-----------|--------------|------------|-----------|---------------
  0              | 1009647   | 0.04         | 3.59       | 8,465%    | ~3.55
  3              | 1009699   | 0.59         | 4.68       | 790%      | ~4.09
  34             | 1010388   | 1.00         | 4.84       | 484%      | ~3.84
  15             | 1010139   | 9.43         | 16.96      | 180%      | ~7.53
  47             | 1010665   | 0.84         | 1.03       | 123%      | ~0.19

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
The original CW area calculations used the full subcatchment boundaries (including lake area).
Now that we're using land area only (excluding the +0.66m lake zone), it's clear that
approximately 19 ha of the identified "potential CW sites" are located in areas that would
be inundated with the raised lake level.

For example, Subcatchment 0:
- Original subcatchment area: 41.72 ha
- Land area (after +0.66m lake exclusion): 0.04 ha (almost entirely lake!)
- CW area identified: 3.59 ha
- This means ~3.55 ha of potential CW sites are in the lake zone

---

QUESTION FOR YOU:
=================

How should we handle this? I see a few options:

Option 1: Re-clip CW shapefiles
   - Clip both CW shapefiles (Type 1 GW and Type 2 SW) to exclude the +0.66m lake inundation area
   - Recalculate CW areas based on clipped polygons
   - This would give us the "true" potential CW area on land only

Option 2: Cap percentages at 100%
   - For subcatchments where CW > land area, set CW area = land area
   - Flag these subcatchments for special handling in MSCMM

Option 3: Use as-is with flags
   - Keep current CW areas but flag problematic subcatchments
   - Document that some CW areas overlap with lake zone
   - Handle in MSCMM modeling phase

My recommendation: Option 1 (re-clip the CW shapefiles) would give us the most accurate
representation of where CWs can actually be constructed. However, I wanted to check with
you first before making this change.

VERIFICATION:
=============

I have verified that the nzsegment matching is correct:
- SubcatchmentID = FID (row index in Subs.shp) = FID_Subs (your data)
- All 50 subcatchments have exactly 1 nzsegment each
- All nzsegment values match between Subs.shp and your LakeAreaUpdate.xlsx
- Documentation saved to: O:\TKIL2602\Working\Lake Omapere Trust\CW_Analysis_Results

Please let me know how you'd like me to proceed with the CW/lake overlap issue.

Nga mihi,
Reza

Hi Annette,

Thanks for the clarification - I've now recalculated everything directly from the GIS shapefiles to understand the issue better.

WHAT I INITIALLY USED:
When I applied your corrections, I used Column 73 "AREALand (HA)" from your LakeAreaUpdate.xlsx (sheet "AreasRedonefromGIS") as the land area for each subcatchment. I then calculated CW percentages as:
  - Type1_GW_Percent = (Type1_GW_Area_ha / Land_Area_ha) × 100
  - Type2_SW_Percent = (Type2_SW_Area_ha / Land_Area_ha) × 100
  - Combined_Percent = (Combined_CW_Area_ha / Land_Area_ha) × 100

That's when the >100% coverage issue appeared for 5 subcatchments.

WHAT I FOUND WHEN RECALCULATING FROM GIS:
I recalculated land areas directly from the shapefiles using:
  - Subs.shp (subcatchment boundaries)
  - Lake Omapere-236.34 mAMSL (+0.66m).shp (lake inundation area)

Formula: Land Area (ha) = Total Subcatchment Area - Lake (+0.66m inundation zone)

Then recalculated CW percentages using these GIS-derived land areas.

For the problem subcatchments:
- SC-0: GIS shows 36.09 ha land (Total 41.72 - Lake 5.63), but Column 73 in your Excel shows 0.04 ha
- SC-3: GIS shows 23.44 ha land (Total 25.45 - Lake 2.00), but Column 73 shows 0.59 ha
- SC-15: GIS shows 99.32 ha land (Total 166.26 - Lake 66.94), but Column 73 shows 9.43 ha

Using the GIS-calculated land areas, there are NO subcatchments with >100% coverage (max is 68%).

THE QUESTION:
Column 73 in your AreasRedonefromGIS sheet is labeled "AREALand (HA)" - what does this exclude beyond the lake? Based on your PDF, it seems to exclude both lake AND marshland (freshwater herbaceous land from LCDB5).

For CW modeling, should we use:
A) GIS land area (Total - Lake only) = 36 ha for SC-0
B) Your Column 73 area (Total - Lake - Marshland) = 0.04 ha for SC-0

If it's (B), then we're back to >100% coverage because CW areas exceed the available non-marsh land.

I've saved the GIS-calculated results to:
O:\TKIL2602\Working\Lake Omapere Trust\CW_Analysis_Results\CW_Coverage_GIS_CALCULATED.xlsx

Happy to jump on a call to go through this in GIS if that helps.

Cheers,
Reza

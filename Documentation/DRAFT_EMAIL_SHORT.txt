Subject: RE: TKIL2602 - Lake Ōmāpere modelling

Hi Annette and Fleur,

I've finished making the corrections Annette outlined - added the nzsegment column, ordered by HydSeq, and updated the land areas using your LakeAreaUpdate.xlsx file. The corrected files are in:
O:\TKIL2602\Working\Lake Omapere Trust\CW_Analysis_Results\

However, I've found an issue we need to sort out. When I recalculated the percentages using the land area (excluding lake), 5 subcatchments now show CW coverage well over 100%. For example:

- Subcatchment 0: 0.04 ha land, but 3.59 ha of CW area (8,465%)
- Subcatchment 3: 0.59 ha land, but 4.68 ha of CW area (790%)
- Subcatchment 15: 9.43 ha land, but 16.96 ha of CW area (180%)

It looks like about 19 ha of the potential CW sites I identified are actually in areas that would be underwater with the +0.66m lake level. This makes sense because I originally calculated CW areas using the full subcatchment boundaries before we excluded the lake.

I think the best fix would be to re-clip the CW shapefiles to exclude the lake inundation area and recalculate. But wanted to check with you first - does that sound right, or would you prefer a different approach?

Let me know what you think.

Cheers,
Reza

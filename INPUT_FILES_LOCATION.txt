Lake Omapere CW Analysis - Input Files Location Guide
=====================================================

IMPORTANT: This guide tells you where all input files are located.
Some large files (~350 MB total) remain on C: drive to save space.


FILES ON O: DRIVE (Small, Essential Files)
-------------------------------------------

Location: O:\TKIL2602\Working\Lake Omapere Trust\Lake_Omapere_CW_Analysis\Input_Data\

✓ CW_Coverage_GIS_CALCULATED.xlsx (8.5 KB)
  - THE MOST IMPORTANT FILE
  - 50 Lake Omapere reaches with CW coverage percentages
  - GIS-calculated, validated, correct

✓ CW_Coverage_by_Subcatchment.xlsx (7.5 KB)
  - Alternative coverage data
  - Script uses GIS_CALCULATED version

✓ Lookups\LRFs_years.xlsx (204 KB)
  - Load Reduction Factor values
  - Contains 23%, 42%, 48% (DOPmed values)
  - Source of corrected LRF values

✓ Shapefiles\ (all shapefiles for mapping)
  - Reference\Riverlines.shp
  - Reference\Catchment.shp
  - Lake\Lake Omapere-236.34 mAMSL (+0.66m).shp
  - Subcatchments\Subs.shp
  - CW_Sites\ (if available)


FILES ON C: DRIVE (Large CSV Files)
------------------------------------

Location: C:\Users\moghaddamr\Reza_CW_Analysis\Model\InputData\

These files are TOO LARGE to copy to O: drive (~350 MB total).
The script MUST be run from C: drive to access these files.

✓ CLUESloads_baseline.csv (102 MB)
  - CLUES model output for baseline scenario
  - 593,517 reaches total (50 are Lake Omapere)
  - Contains TPAgGen, soilP, TPGen columns

✓ CLUESloads_wetland_066m.csv (102 MB)
  - CLUES model output for +0.66m lake level scenario
  - Same structure as baseline
  - Used for wetland comparison

✓ Hydroedge2_5.csv (114 MB)
  - River network connectivity
  - Upstream/downstream relationships
  - HYDSEQ ordering for routing

✓ AttenCarry.csv (30 MB)
  - Attenuation factors (PstreamCarry, PresCarry)
  - How much P sticks to sediment
  - Used in network routing calculations


WHY LARGE FILES STAY ON C: DRIVE
---------------------------------

1. Size: 350 MB is too large for routine O: drive backups
2. Speed: Faster to access from local C: drive
3. Shared: Model/InputData folder has other project files
4. Unnecessary: Only need Lake Omapere subset (50 reaches from 593K)
5. Stable: These files don't change often


HOW TO RUN THE SCRIPT
----------------------

OPTION 1: Run from C: drive (RECOMMENDED)
  cd C:\Users\moghaddamr\Reza_CW_Analysis\Analysis_Scripts
  python lake_omapere_cw_analysis.py

  • Script automatically finds large files in Model/InputData/
  • All paths are relative and work correctly
  • Results save to C: drive Results/ folder

OPTION 2: Copy large files to O: drive (NOT RECOMMENDED)
  • Would need 350+ MB space
  • Would need to update file paths in script
  • No real benefit over Option 1


SCRIPT FILE PATHS (Current Configuration)
------------------------------------------

The script (lake_omapere_cw_analysis.py) has these paths in Config class:

CLUES_BASELINE_PATH = "Model/InputData/CLUESloads_baseline.csv"
CLUES_WETLAND_PATH = "Model/InputData/CLUESloads_wetland_066m.csv"
CW_COVERAGE_XLSX = "CW_Coverage_GIS_CALCULATED.xlsx"
REACH_NETWORK_CSV = "Model/InputData/Hydroedge2_5.csv"
ATTENUATION_CSV = "Model/InputData/AttenCarry.csv"
LRF_XLSX = "Model/Lookups/LRFs_years.xlsx"

These paths are RELATIVE to the script location on C: drive.
They will NOT work if you try to run from O: drive.

BACKUP STRATEGY
---------------

What to backup to O: drive:
  ✓ Scripts (Analysis_Scripts\ folder)
  ✓ Small input files (CW coverage, LRFs, shapefiles)
  ✓ Results (after each run)
  ✓ Documentation

What stays on C: drive only:
  • Large CLUES CSV files (Model/InputData/)
  • Full network data (Hydroedge2_5.csv)
  • These are in the Model/ folder which has its own backup


IF YOU NEED TO RECREATE FROM O: DRIVE
--------------------------------------

If you only have O: drive and need to run the analysis:

1. Copy Analysis_Scripts\ from O: to C: drive
2. Copy Input_Data\ from O: to C: drive
3. Get the large Model/InputData/ files from source:
   - Original location: C:\Users\moghaddamr\Reza_CW_Analysis\Model\InputData\
   - Or request from CLUES model team
4. Place large files in: C:\Users\moghaddamr\Reza_CW_Analysis\Model\InputData\
5. Run script from C: drive location


FILE CHECKSUMS (for verification)
----------------------------------

Key files on O: drive:

CW_Coverage_GIS_CALCULATED.xlsx:  8,684 bytes, 50 reaches
LRFs_years.xlsx:                  204 KB
lake_omapere_cw_analysis.py:      ~150 KB, 1500+ lines

If these files are different sizes, something went wrong in the copy.


SUMMARY
-------

• Small essential files (CW coverage, LRFs, shapefiles): ON O: DRIVE ✓
• Large CLUES/network files (350 MB): ON C: DRIVE (too big for O:)
• Scripts: ON BOTH DRIVES (O: for backup, C: for running)
• Results: COPY TO O: DRIVE after each run
• Documentation: ON O: DRIVE ✓

To run analysis: MUST use C: drive (where large files are)
To backup: Copy scripts + small files + results to O: drive

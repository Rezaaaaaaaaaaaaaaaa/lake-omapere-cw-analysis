LAKE ŌMĀPERE CW ANALYSIS - SESSION SUMMARY
================================================================================
Date: 2025-10-20
Project: TKIL2602 - Lake Ōmāpere modelling
================================================================================

WHAT WE DID:
============

1. READ ANNETTE'S EMAIL (2025-10-20)
   - Annette requested 4 corrections to the CW coverage analysis:
     a) Add nzsegment column (required for CLUES/mitigation model)
     b) Order data by HydSeq in ascending order (flow sequence)
     c) Use her land area calculations that exclude lake area
     d) Recalculate CW percentages based on corrected land areas

2. EXAMINED ANNETTE'S DATA FILE
   - File: O:\TKIL2602\Working\Lake Omapere Trust\CLUES_SS_NRC_2020\LakeAreaUpdate.xlsx
   - Found corrected land areas in Column 73 (sheet "AreasRedonefromGIS")
   - These areas exclude the +0.66m lake inundation zone
   - Copied to: C:\Users\moghaddamr\Reza_CW_Analysis\LakeAreaUpdate.xlsx

3. VERIFIED DATA MATCHING
   - Confirmed: SubcatchmentID = FID (row index) = FID_Subs
   - Each of 50 subcatchments has exactly 1 nzsegment
   - All nzsegment values match between:
     * Subs.shp (original subcatchment shapefile)
     * My CW analysis
     * Annette's LakeAreaUpdate.xlsx
   - The 724 rows in Annette's data represent different land use polygons,
     NOT different stream reaches

4. APPLIED ALL CORRECTIONS
   - Added nzsegment column by merging on SubcatchmentID -> FID_Subs
   - Sorted data by HydSeq in ascending order (9454 to 10697)
   - Updated land areas using Annette's Column 73 data
   - Recalculated all CW percentages: (CW_area / Land_area) * 100

5. DISCOVERED CRITICAL ISSUE
   - 5 subcatchments have CW coverage > 100%
   - Problem subcatchments:
     * SC-0: 8,465% coverage (0.04 ha land, 3.59 ha CW)
     * SC-3: 790% coverage (0.59 ha land, 4.68 ha CW)
     * SC-34: 484% coverage (1.00 ha land, 4.84 ha CW)
     * SC-15: 180% coverage (9.43 ha land, 16.96 ha CW)
     * SC-47: 123% coverage (0.84 ha land, 1.03 ha CW)

   - ROOT CAUSE: ~19 ha of identified CW sites are in areas that would be
     underwater with the +0.66m lake level. Original CW areas were calculated
     using full subcatchment boundaries (including lake area).

6. DRAFTED EMAIL TO ANNETTE & FLEUR
   - Explained all corrections completed
   - Highlighted the >100% coverage issue
   - Proposed solution: Re-clip CW shapefiles to exclude lake zone
   - Waiting for their guidance before proceeding

DATA STRUCTURE:
===============

Corrected CSV columns:
---------------------
1. nzsegment - NZ Segment identifier for CLUES/MSCMM (NEW)
2. HydSeq - Hydrological sequence, headwaters to coast (SORTED BY THIS)
3. SubcatchmentID - Original ID (0-49)
4. Land_Area_ha - Land area excluding +0.66m lake (CORRECTED)
5. Type1_GW_Area_ha - Groundwater-fed CW area
6. Type1_GW_Percent - Type 1 coverage % of land area (RECALCULATED)
7. Type2_SW_Area_ha - Surface water-fed CW area
8. Type2_SW_Percent - Type 2 coverage % of land area (RECALCULATED)
9. Combined_Area_ha - Total CW area
10. Combined_Percent - Combined coverage % of land area (RECALCULATED)

Summary Statistics:
------------------
- Total subcatchments: 50
- Total land area (excluding lake): 1,267.36 ha
- Total Type1 GW CW area: 91.49 ha
- Total Type2 SW CW area: 68.75 ha
- Total Combined CW area: 128.36 ha
- Average combined coverage (valid SC): 12.96%

================================================================================

OUTSTANDING ISSUE:
==================

PROBLEM: 19 ha of CW sites are in the lake inundation zone
---------------------------------------------------------
The CW shapefiles were NOT clipped to exclude the +0.66m lake area.
This causes impossible percentages (>100%) for 5 subcatchments.

PROPOSED SOLUTION:
-----------------
Re-clip both CW shapefiles to exclude lake inundation area:
  - Erase lake polygon from Type 1 GW shapefile
  - Erase lake polygon from Type 2 SW shapefile
  - Recalculate intersection with subcatchments
  - Update CW_Coverage_CORRECTED files

WAITING FOR:
-----------
Annette & Fleur's approval to proceed with re-clipping
(Email drafted and ready to send)

================================================================================

NEXT STEPS:
===========

1. IMMEDIATE:
   - Send draft email to Annette & Fleur
   - Wait for their response on how to handle lake overlap

2. AFTER THEIR RESPONSE:
   If they approve Option 1 (re-clip):
   - Load lake inundation shapefile (+0.66m)
   - Clip CW shapefiles to exclude lake
   - Recalculate CW areas per subcatchment
   - Update CW_Coverage_CORRECTED files
   - Send final corrected files

   If they choose Option 2 or 3:
   - Follow their guidance
   - Document the approach taken

3. FINAL:
   - Verify all corrections with Annette
   - Provide final dataset for MSCMM modeling
   - Archive all working files

================================================================================

KEY LEARNINGS:
==============

1. Subcatchment Structure:
   - 1 Subcatchment → 1 Stream Reach → 1 nzsegment
   - Multiple rows in Annette's data = different land use polygons
   - NOT multiple stream reaches

2. Land Area vs Total Area:
   - Shapefile "Area" = total subcatchment including lake
   - Annette's "Land_Area" = land only, excluding +0.66m lake zone
   - Difference can be HUGE (e.g., SC-0: 41.72 ha → 0.04 ha)

3. GIS Processing Order Matters:
   - Should have clipped CW areas to exclude lake FIRST
   - Then calculated intersection with subcatchments
   - Lesson: Always check for lake/water exclusions in wetland analyses

4. Data Validation is Critical:
   - The >100% percentages flagged the problem immediately
   - Always do sanity checks on calculated percentages
   - Extreme values indicate data quality issues
